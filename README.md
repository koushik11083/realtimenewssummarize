REAL-TIME NEWS SUMMARIZER

This project presents a system designed to automate the extraction, summarization, and categorization of real-time news articles. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), web scraping, and machine learning, the system identifies trending topics using tools like Pytrends, retrieves relevant articles, and processes them using advanced summarization algorithms.

The summarized content is classified into categories such as technology, politics, and sports, ensuring concise and unbiased information delivery. The system operates on an automated pipeline, fetching and updating news periodically while handling errors and adapting to dynamic changes in data sources.
